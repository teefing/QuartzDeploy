There are currently more than 5 plugins about anki or spaced repetition memory in the plugin market. I chose the [[🍀 花园导览/🧰 本库指南/Obsidian/Plugins/Spaced Repetition]] plugin because it does not need to be used with anki, and you can complete card making and card memory within the obsidian software.

And [[🍀 花园导览/🧰 本库指南/Obsidian/Plugins/Spaced Repetition]] has 2 functions. 1 is to support adding multiple memory flashcards with positive and negative content in a note, and 2 is to support setting a note directly as a whole note to be memorized or reviewed. I currently only use the latter. The usage is as follows:

## Quickly set a note as a note to be reviewed

The manual method is: add `tags: reviews` to the [[Cards/frontmatter]] area.

A quicker way is: use the cmd + shift + s shortcut key to achieve the same effect as manual.
	Note: This shortcut key is a simple script for inserting text that I wrote on the mac. It should not be compatible on win, and it cannot handle the scenario where tags already exist in the frontmatter area.

Then immediately start a review action. You can set a shortcut key. My setting is as described in [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Tutorials/Commonly used shortcut keys and their functions in this library#Daily Review Flow]]

## Quickly review the notes that are due on the same day

Every day, according to the number of reviews to be reviewed today on the status bar, click to review the notes one by one. Or directly use the cmd + shift + 0 shortcut key.

You can also call out the right sidebar to get a general overview of the future review plan, as shown in the figure:
